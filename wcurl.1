.B wcurl
- a simple wrapper around curl for easily downloading files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBwcurl [\-o|\-\-opts=\fI<CURL_OPTIONS>\fP...] \fI<URL>\fP...\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwcurl\fR is a simple curl wrapper which lets you use curl to download files
without having to remember any parameters.
.PP
Simply call \fBwcurl\fR with a list of URLs you want to download and \fBwcurl\fR will pick
sane defaults.
.PP
If you need anything more fancy, you can provide any of curl's supported
parameters via the \fB\-o/\-\-opts\fR option.
.PP
.TP
By default, \fBwcurl\fR will:
.br
\[bu]  Encode whitespaces;
.br
\[bu]  Follow redirects;
.br
\[bu]  Automatically chose a filename as output;
.br
\[bu]  Perform retries;
.br
\[bu]  Resume from broken/interrupted downloads.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-o, \-\-opts=\fI<CURL_OPTIONS>\fR...\fR
Options to be passed to the curl invocation.
Note that all options needs to be passed as a single item, so you may
need to suround it with double quotes.
.SH CURL_OPTIONS
Any option supported by curl can be set here, this is not used by \fBwcurl\fR, it's
instead forwarded to the curl invocation.
.SH URL
Anything which is not a paremeter will be considered an URL.
\fBwcurl\fR will encode whitespaces and pass that to curl, which will perform the
parsing of the URL.
.SH EXAMPLES
Download a single file:
.br
\fBwcurl example.com/filename.txt\fR
.PP
Download two files:
.br
\fBwcurl example.com/filename1.txt example.com/filename2.txt\fR
.PP
Download a file passing the \fI\-\-progress\-bar\fR and \fI\-\-http2\fR flags to curl:
.br
\fBwcurl \-\-opts="\-\-progress\-bar \-http2" example.com/filename.txt\fR
