.SH NAME
.B wcurl
- a simple wrapper around curl to easily download files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBwcurl [\-o|\-\-opts=\fI<CURL_OPTIONS>\fP...] \fI<URL>\fP...\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwcurl\fR is a simple curl wrapper which lets you use curl to download files
without having to remember any parameters.
.PP
Simply call \fBwcurl\fR with a list of URLs you want to download and \fBwcurl\fR will pick
sane defaults.
.PP
If you need anything more complex, you can provide any of curl's supported
parameters via the \fB\-o/\-\-opts\fR option. Just beware that you likely
should be using curl directly if your usecase is not covered.
.PP
.TP
By default, \fBwcurl\fR will:
.br
\[bu]  Encode whitespaces in URLs;
.br
\[bu]  Download multiple URLs in parallel;
.br
\[bu]  Follow redirects;
.br
\[bu]  Automatically chose a filename as output;
.br
\[bu]  Perform retries;
.br
\[bu]  Resume from broken/interrupted downloads.
.br
\[bu]  Set the downloaded file timestamp to the value provided by the server, if available;
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-o, \-\-opts=\fI<CURL_OPTIONS>\fR...\fR
Options to be passed to the curl invocation.
Note that all options needs to be passed as a single item, so you may
need to suround it with double quotes.
.SH CURL_OPTIONS
Any option supported by curl can be set here, this is not used by \fBwcurl\fR, it's
instead forwarded to the curl invocation.
.SH URL
Anything which is not a parameter will be considered an URL.
\fBwcurl\fR will encode whitespaces and pass that to curl, which will perform the
parsing of the URL.
.SH EXAMPLES
Download a single file:
.br
\fBwcurl example.com/filename.txt\fR
.PP
Download two files in parallel:
.br
\fBwcurl example.com/filename1.txt example.com/filename2.txt\fR
.PP
Download a file passing the \fI\-\-progress\-bar\fR and \fI\-\-http2\fR flags to curl:
.br
\fBwcurl \-\-opts="\-\-progress\-bar \-http2" example.com/filename.txt\fR
